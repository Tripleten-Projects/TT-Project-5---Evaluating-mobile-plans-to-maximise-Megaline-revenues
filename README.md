# Evaluating mobile plans to maximise Megaline's revenues

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

You work as an analyst for the telecommunications operator Megaline. The company offers its customers two prepaid tariffs, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department wants to know which tariff generates more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget.

You are going to perform a preliminary analysis of the tariffs based on a relatively small selection of customers. You will have the data of 500 Megaline customers: who the customers are, where they are from, what tariff they use, as well as the number of calls they made and text messages they sent in 2018. Your job is to analyse customer behaviour and determine which prepaid tariff generates the most revenue.

## STEPS:

### STEP 1: INITIALIZATION

### STEP 2: LOAD DATA

### STEP 3: PREPARE AND EXPLORE THE DATA

### STEP 4: TEST STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES

## CONCLUSION

The Surf plan provides better benefits to the company. SURF plan users pay more than double their monthly fixed cost of their plan only for excess GB consumption. ULTIMATE plan users do not exceed their call or text message consumption limits, having the same average GB consumption as SURF plan users but do not pay excess because their plan includes a greater amount of GB. We can maximize the benefit of the company doing a bigger campaign for SURF plan
